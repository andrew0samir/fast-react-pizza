## ⚙️ How It Works

Orders are submitted via a `POST` request containing user and order data. In return, the API generates a **unique order ID**, which is displayed to the user for future reference.

  Just enter your name and place your order—no logins or passwords needed.

- **📦 Dynamic Menu**  
  Menu items are fetched from an API so you always see the latest options.

- **🛒 Easy Ordering**  
  Add multiple pizzas to your cart and finalize your order with a name, phone, and address. Optionally, share your GPS location for faster delivery.

- **⚡ Priority Orders**  
  Need your pizza faster? Mark your order as _priority_ for an extra 20% charge.

  You can still mark an existing order as _priority_ after it’s placed.
